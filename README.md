# CryptoClustering
Cryptocurrency clustering exercise using unsupervised machine learning.

All code exists in the Crypto_Clustering Jupyter Notebook inside the CryptoClustering folder. Source data (crypto_market_data.csv) exists inside the Resources folder.

## Answer the following question: 

**Question:** What is the best value for `k`?

**Answer:** Our line plot tells us that 4 is the best value for `k`.

#### Answer the following questions: 

* **Question:** What is the best value for `k` when using the PCA data?

  * **Answer:** It looks like 4 is the best balue for 'k'.


* **Question:** Does it differ from the best k value found using the original data?

  * **Answer:** This is the same as with our original data.

#### Answer the following question: 

  * **Question:** After visually analyzing the cluster analysis results, what is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?

  * **Answer:** Using fewer features allows us to more easily identify outliers. Fewer features also lowered the inertia on our elbow curve.
